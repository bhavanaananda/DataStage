<h1>Adding and removing users</h1>

<p>Currently, in order to add or remove users you will have to be logged in via <a href="../docs/accessdirect.html">SSH</a>
as the user <code>admiral</code>.</p>

<h2>To add a user:</h2>

<p>Run the command <code>sudo su -</code> to have administrative access, using the password for the <code>admiral</code>
user.  Then run the command 
<blockquote>
<code>/root/admiraluseradd.sh <cite>username</cite> <cite>userpass</cite> <cite>grouprole</cite> [<cite>room number</cite> <cite>telephone number</cite>]</code>
</blockquote>
The last two options (room number and telephone number) are optional.  <cite>grouprole</cite> must be one of <code>RGMember</code> (an ordinary member of
the research group), <code>RGLeader</code> (the group leader, who is able to view the private files of all members of the group), or <code>RGCollaborator</code>
(an external collaborator who will have read-only access to the <code>collab</code> area of the file-store).</p>
<p>Once you have run this command, you will be prompted to set an initial password for the user, and then the relevant filespaces will be created and the
appropriate permissions set.</p>
<p><strong>You must then also type <code>/etc/apache2/init.d restart</code> for these configurations to take effect.</strong></p>

<h2>To remove a user:</h2>

<p>Similarly to the process for adding a user you must first issue the command <code>sudo su -</code>  Then run the command
<blockquote>
<code>/root/admiraluserddel.sh <cite>username</cite>
</blockquote>

The user will be removed form the filesystem and (at present) all their files will be deleted.</p>

<p>In the future it is intended that there will be a web-interface to these commands so no magic incantations need be remembered!</p>
