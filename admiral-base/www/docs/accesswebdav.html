<h1>ADMIRAL data file web file system access (WebDAV)</h1>

<p>Selected ADMIRAL data files may be accessed using the web file access protocol, using one of the following forms of URI:
<pre>
	<code>http://%{HOSTFULLNAME}/data/private/<cite>username</cite></code>
	<code>http://%{HOSTFULLNAME}/data/shared/<cite>username</cite></code>
	<code>http://%{HOSTFULLNAME}/data/collab/<cite>username</cite></code>
</pre>
A username and password will be required.  Access controls are enforced as described for local network file access page.
</p>

<p>
Web file access (WebDAV) support is slower and sometimes less reliable than local network file sharing.
It is provided for two main reasons:
<ol>
	<li>It can be used from a system outside the Zoology Department network.</li>
	<li>It can be used by web browser based applications used for annotation, visualization and other tasks.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Web file access using Windows</h2>

<p>Currently, the Windows web file access software does not work with the ADMIRAL server and file protection arrangements &mdash; we'll be looking in to this.</p>

<h2>Web file access using MacOS</h2>

<p>To connect a web file system share from MacOS, use the Finder "Go &gt; Connect to server..." menu command (or COMMAND-K shortcut), and enter
<code>http://%{HOSTFULLNAME}/data/private/<cite>username</cite></code>, or one of the other forms shown above, as the server address.
The system will then prompt for a username and password.	
</p>

<h2>Web file access using Linux</h2>

<p>
Under Linux with GNOME, the ADMIRAL web file system content can be accessed in similar fashion to a local file system,
but using the web address:
</p>

<p>
Use the "Places &gt; Connect to server ..." menu command.  In the popup window, from the "Service type"
drop-down menu, select "WebDAV (HTTP)".  Under "Server" enter <code>%{HOSTFULLNAME}</code> and under
"Folder" enter <code>data/<cite>username</cite></code>, <code>data/shared/<cite>username</cite></code> or <code>data/collab/<cite>username</cite></code>.
Under "Username" enter <code><cite>username</cite></code> and then click on "Connect".
Enter the specified user's password into the next popup window to appear.
</p>

<p>
An alternative mechanism for reading and writing files under Linux is to use the <code>cadaver</code> utility, specifying one of the URI forms listed above.
</p>

<!--
Mount the file system using the <code>davfs</code> file system; e.g.
<pre>
	mount -t davfs -o (((options))) http://<cite>username</cite>@%{HOSTFULLNAME}/data <cite>mountpoint</cite>
</pre>
-->
