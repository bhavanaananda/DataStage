<h1>ADMIRAL data file access from MacOS</h1>

<p>ADMIRAL data files may be accessed from MacOS as a Windows network share:
<blockquote>
<code>\\%{HOSTFULLNAME}\data</code>
</blockquote>
A username and password will be required to complete a connection.
</p>

<p>To connect a Windows share from MacOS, use the Finder "Go > Connect to server..." menu command (or COMMAND-K shortcut), and enter
<code>smb://<cite>username</cite>@%{HOSTFULLNAME}/data</code> as the server address.
The system will then prompt for the specified user's password.	
</p>

<p>Once connected, a user will be able to read/write files in their own private area,
and also to read all files in the <code>shared</code> and <code>collab</code> areas.
